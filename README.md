# Overview

Auralo is an AI-powered, real-time market intelligence platform for the Web3 era. It operates as a persistent overlay for browsers or desktop environments, delivering traders, DeFi users, and researchers instant access to the information that matters most. The platform integrates on-chain analytics, off-chain market data, sentiment tracking, and AI-driven interpretation into a single interface that stays within the user’s workflow.

Today’s market participants face a fragmented environment. Traders monitor multiple dashboards, track social sentiment in separate apps, and watch price action across several exchanges. This fragmented approach slows decision-making, increases the risk of missed opportunities, and requires constant tab switching. Auralo solves this by consolidating critical intelligence into a unified view that is contextually relevant to the task at hand.

Auralo is not simply another data aggregator. It is designed to interpret and prioritize the flood of market information, delivering it directly to the user in real time. The platform helps users see not only what is happening, but why it matters and how it might impact their next move.

The goal is simple: provide a single, intelligent interface that enables better, faster, and more confident decision-making in volatile markets.
