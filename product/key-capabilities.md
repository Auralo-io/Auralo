# Key Capabilities

Auralo is designed to bring multiple high-impact functions into a single, seamless operational layer, eliminating the need for constant tool-switching and providing traders with a unified, context-rich environment for decision-making. Its capabilities are purpose-built to reduce workflow friction, enhance situational awareness, and improve the quality of market reactions.



#### Real-Time Sentiment Aggregation

Market sentiment often shifts before prices follow, making early detection critical. Auralo continuously monitors social media channels, news outlets, influencer commentary, community forums, and blockchain activity to produce a **real-time sentiment index**.

This index is not a static number. It is updated continuously and reflects the current emotional and narrative state of the market. Alongside the index, Auralo generates AI-written summaries that explain **why** sentiment has shifted, citing the primary catalysts such as:

* Regulatory announcements or policy changes
* Influencer-driven narratives and coordinated campaigns
* Sudden volume spikes or whale wallet activity
* Breakthroughs in project development or technology

By combining raw sentiment data with context-rich interpretation, traders gain a faster and more complete picture of market psychology.



#### Technical Overlay Integration

Technical analysis remains a core discipline for traders, yet switching between charting platforms and order execution windows can slow decision-making. Auralo solves this by embedding **AI-driven technical overlays** directly into the user’s exchange or charting interface.

These overlays highlight:

* Dynamic support and resistance zones that update with price action
* Emerging chart patterns such as triangles, flags, and head-and-shoulders formations
* Momentum indicators including RSI shifts, MACD crossovers, and volume divergences

Because these overlays are rendered directly on the active trading screen, users can evaluate setups and act immediately without losing focus or time.



#### Intelligent Alerts

Auralo’s alerting system goes beyond simple price notifications. Traders can configure **custom triggers** for parameters such as price movement thresholds, liquidity shifts, or sudden changes in market depth.

When triggered, alerts appear **inside the overlay itself**, in a subtle, non-intrusive format that allows traders to continue their current tasks without disruption. This ensures that critical updates are visible without pulling the user away from their analysis or execution workflow.



#### AI-Assisted Trade Ideas

Instead of delivering generic buy or sell calls, Auralo generates **context-aware trade opportunities** tailored to the user’s personal strategy, risk tolerance, and watchlist preferences.

These trade ideas are derived from a combined analysis of:

* Current market sentiment
* Relevant technical indicators
* On-chain liquidity and volume patterns
* Historical outcomes for similar setups

Each suggestion includes a brief AI-generated rationale, helping traders quickly assess whether the opportunity aligns with their approach. The goal is not to replace trader judgment but to surface relevant opportunities faster than manual scanning could achieve.
