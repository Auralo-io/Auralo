# Features and Functions

Auralo delivers an integrated set of features that combine AI-driven intelligence, real-time monitoring, and an adaptive user interface. Each function is designed to improve market visibility, reduce cognitive load, and enable faster, more confident decision-making.

#### Live Sentiment Index

The **Live Sentiment Index** continuously aggregates signals from social media channels, crypto news feeds, blockchain mempools, and high-value wallet activity. Data is filtered and interpreted by Auralo’s AI models to present a real-time numerical sentiment score accompanied by concise, plain-language summaries explaining the reasons for any shifts. These summaries highlight key drivers such as regulatory updates, project announcements, whale movements, or viral narratives in trading communities.



#### Technical Overlay

Auralo’s **Technical Overlay** embeds directly into exchange dashboards and charting platforms, providing AI-marked support and resistance levels, trendlines, and recognized chart patterns. This integration allows traders to view actionable technical insights without switching tabs, keeping their focus on execution. The overlay dynamically adjusts as new market data streams in, ensuring that traders always see the most relevant technical context.



#### Customizable Alerts

With **Customizable Alerts**, traders can set highly specific triggers for price changes, liquidity shifts, sentiment swings, or large wallet transactions. Alerts are delivered in a discreet side panel within the HUD, accompanied by direct action links for instant trade execution or further analysis. This ensures traders are informed of key developments without being distracted from their primary workflow.



#### AI Trade Context

The **AI Trade Context** feature generates strategic trade insights by correlating real-time sentiment, technical signals, and historical market patterns. Each trade idea includes the rationale behind the suggestion, making it clear why a specific move might present an opportunity. This transparency helps traders quickly validate whether the insight fits their strategy.



#### New Launch Radar

**New Launch Radar** scans blockchain networks and exchange listings in real time to identify newly launched tokens, NFT collections, or DeFi protocols. It surfaces launch details such as liquidity depth, contract verification status, and early sentiment signals. This enables traders to spot fresh opportunities at the earliest possible stage, often before they appear on mainstream trackers.



#### Trending Markets Tracker

The **Trending Markets Tracker** highlights tokens, trading pairs, and sectors showing unusual activity, whether in volume surges, rapid sentiment shifts, or volatility spikes. Auralo ranks these assets in real time, allowing traders to immediately focus on where the market’s attention is concentrated.



#### Whale Watch

The **Whale Watch** function monitors and flags large wallet movements, whether they involve accumulation, distribution, or bridging across chains. By detecting early positioning from influential holders, traders gain insights into potential market direction before it becomes broadly visible.
