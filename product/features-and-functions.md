# Features and Functions

Auralo provides an integrated suite of capabilities powered by cognitive analytics, real-time insight gathering, and a contextual adaptive interface. Each function serves to enhance oversight, alleviate cognitive burden, and enable timely and accurate decisions.

#### Live Sentiment Index

The Live Sentiment Index synthesizes and processes information from social media platforms, crypto news outlets, blockchain mempools, and the activity of significant wallets. For explanation, Auralo AI straight forwards the real-time perception score alongside numerical metrics and provides plain language summaries justifying the reasons for shifts. These summaries cite regulatory changes, announcement of new ventures, and trading community narratives as significant driving forces.



#### Technical Overlay

Technical Overlay by Auralo integrates into the exchange dashboards, as well as, the charting tools placing AI suggested support and resistance lines, trend lines, and chart patterns. This feature exhibits actionable insights and provides users with the agility to focus on execution, as all required information is on hand. With the incessant stream of new data, the overlay ensures that the most contextual and relevant technical surroundings are displayed to the traders on real-time basis.



#### Customizable Alerts

With Customizable Alerts, traders can configure very specific criteria for notifications concerning price, liquidity, sentiment shifts, or significant cryptocurrency transactions. Alerts pop up in a HUD side panel, marked step-by-step for execution and deeper evaluation. Direct links for trade execution or further evaluation make instant action possible. This allows traders to ignore distractions while remaining up to date on significant changes.



#### AI Trade Context

AI Trade Context analyzes current market and social sentiment, technical indicators, and market activity to formulate specific trade recommendations and generate contextualized insights. Each trade idea also includes explenation which supports the trade, thus making it clear why a certain action can be considered. This openness facilitates the tradersâ€™ validation for strategy alignment.



#### New Launch Radar

New Launch Radar analyzes blockchain networks and exchange listings for newly released tokens, NFT collections, or DeFi protocols in real time. It also provides the sharp fragments of the newly launched items, including liquidity gauge, contract check status, and preliminary sentiment indicators. Thus, traders are able to identify new opportunities long before they can be identified with other trackers.



#### Trending Markets Tracker

The Trending Markets Tracker focuses on the identified tokens, trading pairs, and sectors which either volume surge, sentiment shift, or exhibit occasional spikes in volatility. Trending tokens and sectors are ranked in real time and displayed on the Auralo platform, which enables the traders to shift their focus to the areas with highest attention.



#### Whale Watch

This function monitors large wallet movements whether accumulating, distributing, or bridging across chains, and alerts the user. Noticing early movements from the influential holders enables traders to grasp insights behind possible market direction that is yet to be apparent.
