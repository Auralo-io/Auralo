# Use Cases

Auralo’s HUD is built to serve a wide spectrum of market participants in Web3. Its combination of AI-driven intelligence, real-time overlays, and customizable tools enables each type of user to gain a decisive edge in fast-moving markets.



#### Active Traders

Active day traders and swing traders operate in environments where seconds matter. Auralo provides them with instant access to sentiment, technical context, and market-moving events without the need to toggle between multiple platforms. Features such as **Customizable Alerts** and **Technical Overlays** reduce decision latency and help traders execute with confidence.

**Example Scenario:**\
A trader monitoring Ethereum sees sentiment turning sharply negative on the **Live Sentiment Index** due to an exploit reported on a major DeFi protocol. The HUD instantly overlays key resistance levels, confirming the likelihood of a price drop. The trader acts within seconds, securing a profitable short position before the news reaches wider audiences.



#### DeFi Yield Farmers and Liquidity Providers

For users providing liquidity or farming yield in DeFi protocols, market context is critical to managing impermanent loss and maximizing returns. Auralo’s **Trending Markets Tracker** and **Whale Watch** features help identify inflows and outflows in liquidity pools, signaling where capital is moving.

**Example Scenario:**\
A yield farmer receives a HUD alert that a large liquidity withdrawal has occurred in one of their pools. This early signal gives them time to rebalance and avoid unfavorable conditions.



#### Long-Term Investors and Portfolio Managers

Long-term participants require curated insights rather than constant trade alerts. Auralo’s AI can be configured to provide periodic summaries, highlighting macro sentiment shifts, key whale positions, and project fundamentals. This ensures strategic decisions are informed by the same institutional-grade intelligence without being overwhelmed by day-to-day noise.

**Example Scenario:**\
A portfolio manager uses the **New Launch Radar** to identify promising early-stage tokens that align with their long-term thesis. They integrate these assets into their watchlist while monitoring AI-generated sentiment trends over the following weeks.



#### NFT Traders and Collectors

NFT markets move at high speed, and valuable drops can be missed in minutes. Auralo extends its intelligence layer to track NFT launches, trending collections, and wallet activity from influential collectors.

**Example Scenario:**\
A collector sees that sentiment is spiking for a specific NFT collection on the **Live Sentiment Index**. The HUD shows a sharp increase in sales volume alongside wallet activity from a known top-tier trader. They purchase early before the wider market catches on.



#### Analysts and Researchers

For those conducting deep market analysis, Auralo serves as a research companion that consolidates fragmented data into one overlay. With its plugin ecosystem, researchers can integrate custom data feeds, on-chain metrics, and sector-specific trackers directly into the HUD.

**Example Scenario:**\
An on-chain analyst configures a custom plugin to track DAO governance proposals across multiple protocols. Auralo surfaces sentiment and whale positioning related to these proposals, enabling the analyst to anticipate governance-driven price movements.
