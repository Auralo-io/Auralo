#### Active Traders

Auralo’s HUD serves as a one-stop-shop for swing and day traders, as it amalgamates market sentiment with real-time overlays and contextual market data. The Triage and Decision Hub allows real-time information to flow seamlessly and reduces toggling between separate tools, improving execution confidence and agility for fast-paced traders.

**Example Scenario:**\
An Ethereum trader observes a sharp decline in sentiment on the Live Sentiment Index as an exploit has been reported on a DeFi protocol. HUD confirms the sentiment spike by overlaying key resistance levels crucial for confirming a price drop. The trader acts fast and secures a short position just as the price begins to drop, well ahead of the news becoming public.



#### DeFi Yield Farmers and Liquidity Providers

In DeFi, users offering funding or farming yield to obtain it must understand how to limit impermanent loss to optimize earning. Contextual information is pivotal for maximizing returns. Auralo’s Trending Markets Tracker and Whale Watch make it easy to detect liquidity inflow and outflow, revealing where capital is being directed.

**Example Scenario:**\
To maximize efficiency, a yield farmer leverages a HUD alert system that notifies them of any significant changes in liquidity within their pools. In this instance, they receive a HUD alert claiming that a considerable amount of liquidity has been withdrawn, allowing them to rebalance before it is too late.



#### Long-Term Investors and Portfolio Managers

These investors get tailored insights, as they do not desire to receive trade alerts. In this case, Auralo's AI can be set to provide summaries focused on macro-sentiment changes, key whale movements, and project fundamentals. This helps ensure that strategic decisions are still informed by institutional-level intelligence without being overwhelmed by constant alerts.

**Example Scenario:**\
Through Auralo, a portfolio manager is able to set up a watchlist. Using the New Launch Radar, they add assets associated with promising tokens that are still in their growth stages and align with the long-term thesis, strategically integrating them into their watchlist.



#### Analysts and Researchers

For deep market research, Auralo acts as a research aide to streamline the fragmented datasets. Auralo’s HUD plugins allow incorporating custom mid-and-on-chain data, as well as sector-specific trackers, feeding them directly to the HUD.

**Example Scenario:**\
An on-chain analyst sets a custom plugin for monitoring DAO governance proposals on several protocols. Auralo enriches the sentiment and whale positioning data relative to the proposals, allowing the analyst to forecast governance-related price changes.
