# Compliance

Auralo intends to function compliant with the legal requirements of various regions while maintaining the unobstructed, unrestricted framework of Web3. Compliance ensures the platform's credibility with retails and institutional users while safeguarding enduring reputation of the platform.

#### **Data Privacy and Security**

Auralo complies with the regulations of the European Union and other regions concerning the verification of user identity data by not storing personally sensitive data. Auralo ensures prerequisite user data to be handled lawfully under relevant privacy frameworks. User privacy options, alerts, and plugin settings are also counter decentralized, allowing users to delete or export their data anytime.

Every API call, plugin execution, and market data feeds are handled through encrypted and secure channels. Independent firms will be engaged to conduct security audits on the platform to ensure its robustness and resilience against emerging vulnerabilities.

#### **AML and KYC Considerations**

Auralo operates as a decentralized intelligence layer. However, some features like institutional integrations or Fiat to crypto on-ramps need to be KYC and AML compliant. Such requirements will be fulfilled through compliant, trusted, and sector-aligned third parties to maintain address friction.

For fundamental access to HUD and marketplace, users can remain pseudonymous. However, plugin developers, (and other partners with higher-risk involvement such as governance over treasury funds) may be required to complete KYC to preserve ecosystem integrity.



#### **Cross-Border Operation**

Auraloâ€™s global branding gives it a global audience which means compliance efforts may be modular and more flexible. Jurisdictions that are overly restrictive with regard to cryptocurrency will be assessed individually to ensure that the local restrictions, if any, are met.

#### **Ongoing Legal Monitoring**

The legal landscape for Web3 is changing quickly. Auralo will continue to engage specialists in regulatory compliance, legal counsel, blockchain advocacy groups, and other relevant entities to ensure the platform remains aligned with global best practices. Any major updates in compliance policy will be conveyed clearly and in a timely manner to the community and will be incorporated in updated governance documents.
