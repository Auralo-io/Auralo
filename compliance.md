# Compliance

Auralo is designed to operate in a manner that meets the regulatory expectations of different jurisdictions while preserving the open, permissionless nature of Web3. Compliance is not an afterthought but an integrated principle that ensures the platform’s longevity and credibility with both retail and institutional users.

#### **Data Privacy and Security**

Auralo does not store sensitive personal data unnecessarily. Any required user information is encrypted and handled according to relevant privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and equivalent frameworks in other regions. User preferences, alert settings, and plugin configurations are stored securely, with the option for users to export or delete their data at any time.

All API calls, plugin executions, and market data feeds are routed through secure, encrypted channels. Regular security audits will be conducted by independent firms to ensure platform resilience against vulnerabilities.

#### **AML and KYC Considerations**

While Auralo operates as a decentralized intelligence layer, certain features—particularly institutional integrations or fiat-to-crypto payment gateways—may require Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. These processes will be implemented through trusted, compliant third-party providers to reduce friction while maintaining regulatory alignment.

For general access to the HUD and marketplace, users can remain pseudonymous. However, plugin developers, partners, and participants in certain higher-risk programs (such as governance over treasury funds) may need to complete KYC to ensure the integrity of the ecosystem.

#### **Token Compliance**

The $AUR token will be structured in accordance with prevailing token classification standards to avoid being deemed an unregistered security in major jurisdictions. This involves:

* Careful token utility design to emphasize platform access, staking benefits, and governance participation rather than speculative investment promises.
* Avoidance of profit-sharing language that could trigger securities classification, with revenue-sharing models implemented only in jurisdictions where it is legally permitted.
* Engagement with legal counsel to continually review token-related mechanics as regulations evolve.

#### **Cross-Border Operation**

Given that Auralo will serve a global audience, compliance measures are flexible and modular. Jurisdictions with restrictive cryptocurrency laws will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring that local requirements are met without compromising the platform’s global accessibility.

#### **Ongoing Legal Monitoring**

Web3 regulation is rapidly evolving. Auralo will maintain relationships with compliance experts, blockchain advocacy groups, and legal advisors to ensure the platform remains aligned with global best practices. Any significant changes to compliance policy will be communicated transparently to the community and reflected in updated governance proposals.
