# The Problem Auralo Solves

Web3 markets operate in conditions of perpetual volatility. Sentiment shifts, liquidity flows, and price movements can occur within seconds. However, accessing relevant information is still difficult. For comprehensive market information, traders still need to go through multiple services, all of which provide only partial insight

Important market intelligence consists of:



* Blockchain explorers which reveal publicly available on-chain data, for instance, wallet transactions, token transfers, and contract deployments.
* Centralized exchange dashboards showing order book depth, trade history, and market pairs.
* Decentralized exchange interfaces that offer services such as token swaps, price discovery, and liquidity pool data.
* Social media and community forums that track early shifts in sentiment, narratives, and rumors.
* Pre-configured and interpreted specialized technical charting and backtesting tools.

Such an unorganized ecosystem works against professionals and traders trying to make decisive and timely trading decisions.



**Time Delay**

Inefficient switching between multiple platforms consumes precious seconds in fast-moving markets. By the time a trader pieces together enough information to make a decision, the market will have shifted away from the optimal window.

**Loss of Context**

Tools for displaying the data are not correlating it to wider market happenings. A trader may be unaware of the context behind a spike in token price, for example, a spike may seem to be bullish from a DEX chart view, but it may have been caused by a single whale wallet on-chain.

**Information Overload**

An overwhelming, unprocessed stream of information can lead to confusion instead of clarity. Traders who have spent years in the industry still have to battle against a flood of dozens of feeds. Everything starts to look the same, and in the midst of it, high-quality intelligence goes ignored.

**Missed Opportunities**

Traders are likely to miss important entry or exit points without effective systems to proactively keep track of market shifts. Sometimes, sophisticated systems/algorithms can identify market shifts that pose high value, but most of the time, traders are not looking from the right focus lens.
