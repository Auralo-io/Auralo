# Development Timeline

Auralo’s roadmap is structured in progressive phases, each focused on delivering tangible value to users while expanding the platform’s capabilities. The timeline is designed to ensure that early adopters benefit from immediate functionality, while the broader vision unfolds in structured, iterative releases.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational HUD and Early Access**

**Core Deliverables:**

* **Live Sentiment Index** powered by AI aggregation and contextual summaries
* **Basic Custom Alerts** for price, liquidity, and sentiment shifts
* **Technical Overlays** with AI-marked support/resistance levels and chart patterns
* **Seamless Exchange Integration** for centralized and decentralized platforms
* **Closed Beta Access** available exclusively to token stakers, fostering an early power-user community

**Objectives:**\
The primary goal of Phase 1 is to establish the core Auralo HUD and validate its speed, accuracy, and integration capabilities. This phase focuses on reducing workflow friction for traders and analysts by embedding actionable intelligence directly within their existing tools.

#### **Phase 2: Expansion and Developer Ecosystem**

**Core Deliverables:**

* **Plugin SDK Launch** enabling developers to build and deploy new HUD capabilities
* **Auralo Marketplace Opening** for distribution of official and third-party plugins
* **Expanded Exchange & Protocol Coverage** to include more niche DeFi platforms, NFT analytics, and emerging L2 ecosystems
* **Custom Dashboard Layouts** allowing users to design and save personalized HUD configurations

**Objectives:**\
Phase 2 transforms Auralo from a powerful intelligence tool into an extensible platform. By opening the ecosystem to third-party developers, Auralo ensures continuous innovation and a wider range of integrations. This phase also strengthens network effects, as more users and developers contribute to the ecosystem’s growth.

#### **Phase 3: Autonomous Intelligence and Strategy Execution**

**Core Deliverables:**

* **AI-Powered Automation** that can execute predefined strategies when specific market conditions are met
* **AI Model Marketplace** where developers can publish proprietary analytics and automation models for use within Auralo
* **Cross-Market Strategy Execution** enabling actions across both centralized and decentralized venues from within the HUD
* **Advanced Risk Management Tools** integrating stop-loss, take-profit, and multi-step trade logic directly into the overlay

**Objectives:**\
Phase 3 positions Auralo as not only an intelligence layer but also an **execution layer**. By combining real-time detection with automated response, Auralo allows users to transition from reactive trading to proactive, rule-based strategies. The AI model marketplace further decentralizes innovation, enabling the platform to evolve faster than any single development team could achieve alone.
